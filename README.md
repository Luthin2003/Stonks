## Setting Up the Application

1. **Backend Setup:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
     ```
     cd back
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Wait for 2-3 minutes to allow data gathering.
     > **Note:** The application uses data from the previous day and matches the current time period for showing data. This is because the free tier of Polygon, used to fetch data, does not provide live stock data. Additionally, the 2-3 minute waiting period is due to the fact that Polygon only allows 5 requests per minute for free tier users.


2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Open another terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```
     cd path/front
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Now, you can start the frontend of the application.

   ```
   npm start

npm i
